A simulator of a simple CPU and Memory. It is sophisticated enough toexecute sorting.

The inspiration for the machine many years ago was the machine described inDECKER, R. and HIRSHFIELD, S. The Analytical Engine: An Introduction to Computer Science Using the Internet, PWS Publishing,Boston, 1998.(see http://doctord.dyndns.org/Courses/UNH/CS216/The+PIPPIN+Machine.pdf) but this one is VERY different.
